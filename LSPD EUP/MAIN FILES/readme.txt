PLEASE DO NOT MODIFY, RIP, REDISTRIBUTE OR CONVERT ANY OF THE CONTENTS INCLUDED IN THIS ARCHIVE.

OVERVIEW
--------
This EUP pack is for the Los Santos Police Department. This pack features both male and female options as well as both FiveM and Singleplayer options. 

This pack has taken me quite a while to finish due to me working on finishing other projects such as the BCSO EUP and livery packs.

It contains multiple items that I'm sure you will enjoy. K-9, S.R.T and Gang Unit uniforms can be found alongside the patrol uniforms.

In order to fully enjoy this EUP pack to it's fullest potential, you must use EUP 9.3 and up. Previous versions of EUP will not work.

This pack will possibly be updated on occasion to include new content.

No presetoutfits.xml has been added to this pack.





INSTALLATION
------------
